# Clock-Driven-Verilog-Modules-Counter-FSM
This repository contains two Verilog modules—a 4-bit synchronous up-counter and an input-triggered finite state machine (FSM)—along with simulation testbenches. Designed to demonstrate clock-driven logic, memory retention, and real-time state transitions using edge detection and synchronous resets.
